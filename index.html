      <h2>Do we live in a fake reality?</h2>

      <h5>Realities, Dec 7, 2021, 12:05 pm</h5>

      <b> <p> 
     
    <font size="px">It is not the first time you might have heard of ''social media is harmful to us''<br>
        or the counterargument that ''It's helpful if you could give it a chance''<br>
<br>
      I've always thought of the internet as its own culture, with its own set of celebrities, values, and in-jokes,<br>
      as well as sub-sections of the internet/bubbles (eg: clothing, tv shows, beauty-related topics, fashion etc..);<br> 
      its why a lot of in-jokes don't work in real life, the same way, for example, slang from the UK<br>
      about the UK won't work in the USA, and certain things get spread around to broader parts of the<br>
      internet while some stay in a smaller niche. Social media's algorithms are making our worlds<br>
       so personalized to us that it makes us even more isolated from each other.<br>
<br>
      I keep thinking about how you can tell a lot from a person if you know<br>
      about their interests online. We live in a sort of fake reality online where,<br> 
      because of our lack of real experiences in certain parts of the real world,<br>
      we think that whomever we see or listen to online are just like the<br>
      people in the real world, especially now that many of us are<br>
      still staying at home during the pandemic.<br>
<br>
      To a large extent, the replacement of "reality" with "simulacra" and "hyperreality"<br>
      is caused by cultural and economic factors, and mediated by accompanying cultural changes.<br> 
      The commodification of everything that used to have an intrinsic worth in human social life.<br> 
      Since social media are both a reflection of society, and also constitute a profitable<br>
      marketplace of ideas, they are rife with commodified memes mere simulacra of<br> 
      real-life issues and concerns.
<br>
<br>
      I'm of course no better than a person that does consume media, may I also say,<br>
      I've also fallen victim to this manufactured-fake world we live in.<br>
      I won't claim that media is bad nor will<br>
      I claim that it is destructive.</p> </font>
